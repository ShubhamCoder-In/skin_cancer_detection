            Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer that develops
            from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. It can
            spread rapidly to other parts of the body if not detected early. It
            usually appears as a new spot on the skin or an existing mole that
            changes in color, size, or shape. Early detection is crucial for
            successful treatment.

            Nevus, also known as moles, are benign growths on the skin that
            arise from melanocytes. They are typically harmless but should be
            monitored for any changes that might indicate melanoma.

            This category includes a combination of Dermatofibroma (df),
            Vascular Lesions (vasc), Actinic Keratosis (akiec), and Basal Cell
            Carcinoma (bcc). Each type has its unique characteristics and
            implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dermatofibroma (df):</strong> Dermatofibroma is a common
            benign skin nodule that is usually firm and has a brownish color. It
            is often found on the legs and can sometimes itch or be tender when
            touched.

          <p>
            <strong>Vascular Lesions (vasc):</strong> Vascular lesions are
            abnormalities of the blood vessels that appear on the skin. They can
            be red or purple and can vary in size and shape. While they are
            usually benign, they can sometimes cause cosmetic concerns or
            discomfort.

          <p>
            <strong>Actinic Keratosis (akiec):</strong> Actinic Keratosis is a
            precancerous growth that appears as a rough, scaly patch on
            sun-exposed areas. If left untreated, it can develop into squamous
            cell carcinoma.

          <p>
            <strong>Basal Cell Carcinoma (bcc):</strong> Basal Cell Carcinoma is
            the most common type of skin cancer. It typically appears as a
            pearly or waxy bump, often with visible blood vessels. Although it
            rarely spreads to other parts of the body, it can cause significant
            damage to surrounding tissues if not treated.

            Each of these conditions requires careful monitoring and management
            to prevent complications. Regular skin checks and consultations with
            a dermatologist are essential for maintaining skin health and
            catching any potential issues early.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
        <div class="mt-2">
          <h4 class="font-bold">What are the warning signs of skin cancer?</h4>
          <p>
            Look for new growths, spots, bumps, patches, or sores that don't
            heal. Changes in the appearance of a mole or a sore that doesn’t
            heal are also warning signs.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-bold">How is skin cancer diagnosed?</h4>
          <p>
            A dermatologist will examine your skin and may take a biopsy of any
            suspicious areas for laboratory analysis.
          </p>
          <h4 class="font-bold">Is skin cancer treatable?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, skin cancer is highly treatable when detected early. Treatments
            may include surgical removal, radiation therapy, and topical
            medications.
